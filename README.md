# Project-1-Sandbox-Firewall-Access-Control-CS4371-CS5378
Built a VirtualBox sandbox with two subnets and configured pfSense as the router/firewall. Implemented and validated segmentation + policies using Nmap/Zenmap, Wireshark, curl, and SSH tests and packet captures. Designed an access-control matrix, created WAN/LAN/OPT1 rules, and documented traffic behavior before/after rule deployment.
